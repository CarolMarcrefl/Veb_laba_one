        <h1 class="Title_one Summery">Corgi</h1>

        <span class="one" id = "first">Corgis are ranked 11 among the most intelligent dog breeds. They are easy to train, very quick learners, and tend
        to know a ton of fun tricks! If you are someone who loves to teach your dog new things, corgis might be the perfect 
        dog for you. On the downside, their intelligence makes them a little stubborn. Since they’re so smart, they love to 
        test their humans to see what they can get away with, and sometimes only decide to listen when they know they’re going
        to be rewarded. My corgi Willo knows when I have a treat, and when I don’t! So if she knows she’s not going to be getting
        a treat for listening, she won’t do what I ask. On the plus side, she is very food-driven and is super eager to please when
        she knows there are treats involved! Consistency is key when it comes to training this smart breed. If you’re consistent in 
        their training, they will be the best, and most well-behaved dogs.</span>
        <p class="two">Your Corgi will need a balanced diet rich in nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. It’s best to feed them complete 
        dog food to ensure that they are getting the right amount of vitamins and nutrients.</p> 
        <p class="three">Growing pups may prefer 3-4 smaller servings during the day, rather than two larger meals. This can be reduced 
        to two meals a day as your dog gets older.</p>
        <p class="four">The Pembroke is the smaller of two breeds of Welsh Corgis -- the larger, less popular Cardigan is the other. 
        Corgis are intelligent and courageous, as befitting a small dog developed to herd big livestock. Devoted to their 
        families, they can be protective of them as well. Corgis are lively and entertaining, but they can be bossy if limits 
        aren’t set and kept. They benefit from early socialization and manners training.</p>
        <p class="five">Pembroke Corgis are active dogs who don’t allow short legs to slow them down. They need regular exercise – and portion
        control --- to help with their tendency towards putting on weight. Keeping them fit is essential to help with the health
        risks posed by their long backs. Always on the alert, they also need early training to minimize barking.</p>
        <p class="six">The recommended portion size will depend on your individual dog. You’ll need to take into account their activity
        level, age and metabolism. To avoid weight gain, make sure your Corgi has a healthy and balanced diet and gets 
        plenty of exercise</p>  
        <div>The Corgi is whip-smart, so their owners should be, too. They’re loyal and obedient, easily trained and can adapt to many 
        living situations. Corgis are especially fond of kids and are agreeable with other pets</div> 
        <div class = 'div_one'>Corgis make better exercise buddies than they appear, as they were originally bred to drive livestock. They’re fast, 
        powerful and have impressive endurance. Their herding background means they also love having a job. Corgis are a vocal breed 
        and vigilant guardian with a “big dog” bark.</div>
        <div class = 'div_two'>They love the outdoors and thrive on mental stimulation and physical activity. Many Corgis are good at agility, obedience, 
        herding and tracking activities</div>
